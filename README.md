# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Text Preprocessing -> Data Exploration -> Feature Extration -> Model Building

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning**. The goal is to classify tweets as **positive, negative, or neutral** based on their content. The project follows a structured pipeline, including **text preprocessing, data exploration, feature extraction, and model building**.

## Methodology  

### 1. Text Preprocessing  
- **Cleaning:** Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.  
- **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words or tokens.  
- **Stopword Removal:** Eliminate common words that do not contribute much to sentiment.  
- **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their base or root form.  

### 2. Data Exploration  
- **Sentiment Distribution:** Visualize the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.  
- **Word Cloud:** Generate word clouds for each sentiment category to identify common words.  
- **N-gram Analysis:** Analyze the frequency of bigrams and trigrams.  

### 3. Feature Extraction  
- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Convert text into a matrix of word counts.  
- **TF-IDF:** Transform text into a matrix of TF-IDF features.  

### 4. Model Building  
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different algorithms such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest**.  
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
